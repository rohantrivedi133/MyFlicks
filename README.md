# Project 1 - *MyFlicks*

**MyFlicks** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [X] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I would like to discuss implementation of a status search bar
2. I would like to discuss the addition of network errors and animation

## Notes

implementing the collection view was a little challanging due to creating a new set of code for the collection view. Additionaly attempting to work on implementing a search bar was a little difficult.
